## Onboarding + identity
- First-run ritual started with user.
- Agent identity confirmed:
  - Name: Eden
  - Creature: Digital sidekick / personal assistant
  - Vibe: Witty and concise
  - Emoji: 🌱
- User identity confirmed:
  - Name: Jovaughn
  - Call them: Jo
  - Timezone: America/Toronto

## Core preferences (from SOUL conversation)
- Prioritize proactive help to keep projects/tasks on track and simplify day-to-day life.
- Use gentle nudges and check-ins.
- Interruptions are okay any time.
- Ask first when unsure unless Jo says otherwise.
- No spending without explicit approval.

## Channel setup notes
- WhatsApp initially failed with "Unsupported channel: whatsapp" due plugin not enabled.
- iMessage troubleshooting:
  - `imsg` installed and usable after permissions fixes.
  - Gateway channel remained flaky with recurring `imsg rpc exited (code 1)` logs.
- Google Chat:
  - Personal Google account had incoming webhooks greyed out in Chat space UI.
  - Jo shared a Google Chat webhook URL later.
  - `openclaw channels add --channel googlechat --webhook-url ...` failed because Google Chat channel requires `--token` or `--token-file` (service account JSON), not just incoming webhook URL.
- Plugins enabled during session:
  - `googlechat`
  - `whatsapp`
- WhatsApp login retried after enabling plugin and produced live QR successfully; pending scan confirmation from Jo.

## Actions performed
- Sent iMessage to Robyn at +14169532252: "Jo says thanks."
