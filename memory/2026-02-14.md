- Jo asked me to organize Desktop files without touching existing folders; I created category folders and moved 107 loose files into them.
- Jo requested launching Cursor remotely; launch succeeded.
- Ongoing task: clone the `biblequest` repo in Cursor via UI. Attempts failed due to missing/incorrect repo target and local auth/access constraints. Jo enabled macOS Accessibility/Automation for keystrokes.
