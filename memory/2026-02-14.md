- Jo asked me to organize Desktop files without touching existing folders; I created category folders and moved 107 loose files into them.
- Jo requested launching Cursor remotely; launch succeeded.
- Ongoing task: clone the `biblequest` repo in Cursor via UI. Attempts failed due to missing/incorrect repo target and local auth/access constraints. Jo enabled macOS Accessibility/Automation for keystrokes.
- Jo wants to build a direct iPhone app to chat with Eden and stop relying on WhatsApp.
- Agreed backend approach: Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Cloud Functions bridge to OpenClaw, optional FCM/Storage).
- Installed Firebase CLI (`firebase-tools`) on host and confirmed login as `jovaughna.stephens@gmail.com`.
- Created new Firebase project for the app: `edenchat-jo` (display name: EdenChat, project number: 159607153044).
